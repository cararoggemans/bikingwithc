    title: "Don’t Let AI Steal Your Voice",
    alt: "An illustration of AI and human interaction",
    description: "AI might be your ultimate sidekick, but if you’re not careful, you risk letting it steal your brand’s soul.",
    date: "2025-01-25",
    start_content: "You can’t avoid it anymore: AI is everywhere. From perfectly captioned Instagram posts to blogs that seem to write themselves, Facebook events promising unforgettable nights and the sudden explosion of digital e-books. It’s clear: AI is conquering the digital world. Everyone’s experimenting with prompts, image generation and endless possibilities. And honestly? I get it. Tools like ChatGPT can be an incredible help: they save time, spark ideas and even act as top-tier spell-checkers.",
    middle_content_1: "But here’s the problem: most people open ChatGPT, type in a vague prompt and copy-paste the output without a second thought. If that’s your approach, it’s like letting a robot take over your dating profile. Sure, it’ll send messages and keep up with small talk, but will it truly capture your voice, values and personality?",
    middle_content_2: "When it comes to your brand, authenticity is everything. AI can generate amazing headlines and full blog posts, but if you just let it do all the work without adding your own unique touch, your content will feel empty. It won’t stand out. It won’t connect. Your audience might read it, but they won’t feel it.",
    end_content: "So, what’s the secret? Collaboration. Don’t let AI replace you, but let it assist you. Start by crafting strong, specific prompts. Add your own voice and perspective and don’t hesitate to tweak the final result to make it unmistakably you. Let your personality, or your brand’s identity, shine through. People crave connection and authenticity and that’s something AI simply can’t replicate.",
    final_content: "Your audience is here for YOU. Keep that personal touch alive and never let the robots steal the show. Craft content that feels human."

    date: "2025-01-23",
    start_content: "Instagram is stepping away from its iconic square format, marking a bold move away from its heritage. Over the years, vertical uploads have taken over, fueled by the popularity of Reels and the shift to full-screen mobile experiences. This change addresses a long-standing frustration: users having to crop their photos to fit the square, often cutting out important details in the process.",

    end_content: "Reactions to this change have been mixed. Some users praise the move as a step forward for creative freedom, while others feel it dilutes Instagram’s identity. Whether you’re team vertical or a square purist, one thing is clear: Instagram is evolving, and its users are evolving with it.",
    final_content: "What’s your take on the change? Are you embracing vertical uploads, or do you miss the iconic squares?"

    description: "Good design takes time. Here’s why slowing down can lead to better work and a better process.",
    date: "2025-01-15",
    start_content: "We live in a world where everything is about being faster. Deadlines are tight, trends change quickly and clients expect results right away. As a designer, it’s so easy to get caught up in this rush, trying to finish projects as quickly as possible. But here’s the question: when did speed become more important than creating something truly great?",
    middle_content_1: "I’ve realized that good design, design that really makes an impact, takes time. Time to think, to try different ideas and to make it better. Rushing often leads to work that’s just okay. It might do the job, but it won’t stand out or leave a lasting impression..",
    middle_content_2: "That’s why I’ve started slowing down with my design process. It’s not about wasting time: it’s about being thoughtful. It’s about asking the right questions, giving ideas time to grow and focusing on the details that make a design unique.",

    end_content: "I know it’s not always easy to slow down. There’s often pressure to deliver fast, especially in a world where trends come and go so quickly. But when I take my time, not only is the final result better, but I also enjoy the process so much more. Design is more than just finishing tasks. It’s about creating something meaningful, telling a story, and connecting with people. That can’t happen in a rush. So, let’s stop thinking faster is always better. Great ideas take time, and they’re worth it.",
    final_content: "Slow design has helped me create better work and enjoy my creativity more. Could slowing down help you too?"
