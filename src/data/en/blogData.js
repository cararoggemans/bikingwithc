Last vacation I chose a long-haul flight, but next year Iâ€™m going back to a proper motorcycle trip. And this time, not soloâ€”my partner is working on his A license and will join me.",
    middle_content_1: "For me the adventure begins at the planning table. First I look at possible destinations, then I sketch out a rough day-by-day plan, and finally I dive into the detailed route work. It takes patience, but I love it. It already feels like the first kilometers of the trip.",

Riding a bike is far more intense than driving a carâ€”after 500 km youâ€™re physically and mentally done. Thatâ€™s why I mix â€˜fast daysâ€™ (motorway, covering distance) with â€˜scenic daysâ€™ (slower, twistier, more rewarding).",

Thatâ€™s where I draw the routes myself: start and finish, fun detours, and timing for the overnight stop. It takes time, but I see it as part of the funâ€”my mind is already riding while I plan.",
