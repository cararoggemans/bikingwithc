    "intro": "Hi there, nice to meet you! I’m Cara — content creator and graphic designer with a huge passion for motorcycling. As a kid, I often rode along with my dad, watching my parents take long trips together and thinking: “One day, I want that too.” Years later I got my own license, and that’s when the real adventure started.",
    "middle": "My first solo ride felt like coming home — but also a little like being lost. What I missed? Someone who understands what it’s like to ride alone. Someone to ask: Is this normal? Do you feel that too?",
    "outro": "That’s why I started BikingWithC. I want to be that person for others, and create a space where you can ask questions, have doubts, and just ride at your own pace."
